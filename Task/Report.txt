# 📧 Phishing Email Analysis – Task 2

## 📝 Task Objective
To identify phishing indicators from a suspicious email that mimics Microsoft 365 and develop skills in email threat detection.

## 📌 Sample Phishing Email Overview

- **Email Display Name**: Microsoft 365 Support
- **Sender Address**: support@office-365-notifications[.]com
- **Recipient**: john[.]doe@mybusiness[.]com
- **Subject**: Security Alert – Recover Your Account
- **Email Screenshot**: See attached image `phishing_microsoft_email.png`

## 🔍 Phishing Indicators Identified

### 1. **Suspicious Sender Address**
- The sender email `support@office-365-notifications[.]com` is **not** an official Microsoft domain.
- Microsoft official communications usually come from `@microsoft.com` or `@accountprotection.microsoft.com`.

### 2. **Urgent Language**
- The message tries to create fear:  
  > "We think that someone else has accessed your Microsoft account..."  
  > "If you haven’t already recovered your account, we can help you do it now."

- This is a typical social engineering tactic to make the user act quickly without thinking.

### 3. **Call to Action: “Recover Account” Button**
- The button likely leads to a phishing website (not clicked for safety).
- Real Microsoft links would point to `https://account.microsoft.com` or a known subdomain.

### 4. **Generic Greeting**
- No name used (e.g., “Dear John”) — it's addressed generally to "john.doe@mybusiness.com", making it **less personal**.

### 5. **Visual Impersonation of Microsoft**
- Uses Microsoft branding, colors, and layout to trick the user into thinking it's official.
- This is **brand impersonation**, which is common in phishing.

### 6. **No Digital Signature or Header Info Provided**
- Without an email header, we cannot confirm SPF/DKIM/DMARC status — usually a red flag in spoofed mails.
